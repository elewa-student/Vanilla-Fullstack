Hello.  This is a first draft demo of one stage in the class project series.  It's backend consists of two services:
* Static to serve the frontend application
* CRUD API to connect to the frontend

You can access the API either directly from the hosting, or from any third party application (thanks to CORS).  You can see both in action:
* [Access via Heroku](https://polar-chamber-20771.herokuapp.com/)
* [3rd Party API acces](https://elewa-student.github.io/Vanilla-Fullstack)
